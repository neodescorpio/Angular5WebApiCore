# Angular 5 with WebApiCore
This is my effort for solution that will have a good architecture for exposing APIs for all kind of data operations secured by Token generated by one separate Auth Server, all this consumed by a front end made with Angular 5.

There are many examples on RepositoryPattern and and UnitOfWork present nowadays but none of them in my opinion are ready to be used in some production projects. This code is mixed and modified from lot of sources from internet and modified in past a few months to work like this.
This project will consist mainly of three components
1. Resource API in ASPNETCORE WebAPI
2. Authentication API made with ASPNET Identity CORE
3. Web UI made in Angular 5
## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of dotnet core
- Knowledge of entityframework core
- Knowledge of WebAPI
- N-Tier architecture

_PS: I'm developing in dotnet from quite a long time but this is my first time to post something to github or come online to share my experience. So please bother with me and suggestions are very welcomed._
